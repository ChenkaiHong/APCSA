# APCSA
Students wishing to prepare for the AP Computer Science A examination should complete this course or AP Computer Science with Data Structures. Equivalent to a first-semester college computer science course, APCS is an introduction to the study of algorithms and basic data structures. Using a modern programming language chosen by the College Board, students complete a series of programming projects designed to reinforce the theory learned. Emphasis is placed on good software engineering practices including problem specification, design techniques, documentation and testing. The basic concepts include control structures, arrays, recursion, methods (including preconditions and post-conditions) and well-designed structured code. Students practice their programming skills through multiple projects, including writing Tetris and a word analysis program. Currently, AP CS A uses the Java programming language.
